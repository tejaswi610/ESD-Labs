// Section 07 — `this`

// A class that keeps its own list. It works when you call list.add(4).
// It breaks when add() is passed around as a callback:
//     [4, 10, 18].forEach(list.add)
// because the method loses `this`. Fix it so add works even when detached.
// Two accepted fixes: bind in the constructor, or make add an arrow-function
// class field. Pick one and be able to explain why it works.
